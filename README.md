Here's a `README.md` file for your directory space calculation script:

# Directory Space Calculator

This Python script calculates the total size of all files within a specified directory (including its subdirectories). It's a simple tool that recursively traverses a directory and sums up the sizes of all contained files.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Example](#example)
- [Limitations](#limitations)

## Requirements

- Python 3.8.10 or higher
- Ubuntu 20.04.3 (The script should also work on other Linux distributions and macOS, as well as on Windows with slight modifications.)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dirspace-calculator.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd dirspace-calculator
   ```

3. **Ensure Python is installed**:
   - You can check your Python version by running:
     ```bash
     python3 --version
     ```

## Usage

To calculate the total size of all files in the current directory:

1. Run the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python3 dir_space_calculator.py
   ```

2. The script will output the total size of all files in the directory.

### Custom Directory

If you want to calculate the size of a specific directory, modify the `main()` function in the script:

```python
def main():
    total = dirSpace("/path/to/your/directory")
    print(f"Total size: {total} bytes")
```

Replace `"/path/to/your/directory"` with the desired directory path.

## Example

```bash
$ python3 dir_space_calculator.py
Total size: 123456789 bytes
```

## Limitations

- **Symbolic Links**: The script does not currently account for symbolic links. It treats them as regular files and sums up their sizes.
- **Special Directories**: The script ignores special directories such as `.` and `..` but may still encounter issues if the target directory contains unusual filesystem structures.
- **Performance**: The script may take a significant amount of time to run on directories with a large number of files or deep directory trees.
